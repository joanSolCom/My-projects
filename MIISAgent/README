MIIS Agent by Juan Soler Company
--------------------------------

This project is about implementing the MIIS agent we specified using a FSM in the last assignment.

To do that, I implemented it using C++. This is a text-based agent that tells you about the MIIS 
program.

To execute the program, you only have to do:

./MIISAgent

If you have any trouble to execute the already compiled file, you can re-compile it using this commands:

make clean
make

The source code is in the files 

texts.h ---> Header File, where we can see the definition of the structures and global variables
texts.cpp -> The source file, where the texts are assigned, and some functions are defined
main.cpp --> The main, in this file, the execution is controlled, this is where the interaction
	     between the user and the system is done.

The system works as the user says the expected keywords. For a easy use of the program, this keywords
are the words that are printed using upper cases.

The user has to enter his/her phrase when the prompt looks like this:

---> USERS TEXT

In any point, if the user wants to exit the program, just by saying goodbye the system will exit.

The texts are the same that were shown in the last assignment.

The structures that have been used are associative arrays (in C++, called maps), to use the keywords
to index the array which contains the full texts.
