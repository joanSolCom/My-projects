Juan Soler Company----> Earley Parser

This program contains a python implementation of the Earley parser. 
To invoke this program, you simply need to execute this command:

python earleyParser.py grammar.json "sentence to parse"

The first parameter is the file where the main program is, the second is the
name of the file where the grammar is and the last parameter is the sentence to parse.

The grammar is written in json. This grammar recognises phrases like this:

"I want to know about the subjects"
"Tell me about the content"
"About prizing"
"Enrollment"
"Tell me about subjects"
"I want to know about prizing"

To see more details, please look at the file itself.

The output of the programm can be, either an error, because the sentence structure
is not correct, or an error telling you that you introduced a unrecognized word,
or the solution of the parsing process. This looks like this:

CORRECT!!!:  ( -> S ., [0, 4], [(S -> VP ., [0, 4], [(VP -> Verb Objective-Pronoun NP ., [0, 4], [(Verb -> tell ., [0, 1]), (Objective-Pronoun -> me ., [1, 2]), (NP -> Prep Noun ., [2, 4], [(Prep -> about ., [2, 3]), (Noun -> content ., [3, 4])])])])])

If you want to know how the process came to this conclusion, you can turn the debug mode on, by
changing the value of the variable debug to 1, in the file earleyParser.py . This will output results of applying the different operators
the Earley Parser algorithm uses.
